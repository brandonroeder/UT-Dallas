UT-Dallas
=========

I was annoyed that UTD is really the only "big" school without an iOS app, so I started this project just to see how much functionality I could incorporate.
It doesn't have much use at the moment, as I can't access some of the things that other schools apps have (class schedules, student directory, etc) and I'm not certain I'll even continue to build it.

It also uses a bunch of the UTD graphics which I don't think I am allowed to use, so I couldn't put this in the app store without the school's permission.
